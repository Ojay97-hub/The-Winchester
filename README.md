# THE WINCHESTER 

The Winchester is a website that brings together fans of the movie "Shaun of the Dead" who wish to embark on an immersive food and drink experience that is likened to the theme of the famously referenced pub "The Winchester Tavern"; which has even turned into a viral internet meme during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the famous line "Then pop to the Winchester and wait for all this to blow over". This is simply to be applied to any other catastrophe and in the context of "Shaun of the Dead" this happened to be a zombie apocolyspe. This website is the gateway to a fun filled "Shaun of the Dead" pub style immersive experience but that also maintains the setting of your typical British Pub.
